To install tumx in your termux you will first need to update the packages by typing...

    pkg update && pkg upgrade

After that you need to type a command which will basically install the tumx

    pkg install tmux

## Basic command

After you successfully install tmux. You will see message like this 

    Unpacking tmux (3.2) ...
    Setting up tmux (3.2) ...
    Processing triggers for man (1.14.5-2) ...

Now move on the basic commands.

To start the program, first simply type :

    tmux

Remember if you want to use this command than first you need to type <br>` CTRL + b ` after than the command.

> <b>Eg</b> : To split a screen in vertical orientation your need to first type ` CTRL + b ` after than " % " percentage symbol.

| Command | Description |
| - | - |
| % | Vertical Split      |
| " | Horizontal split |

This are the command commonly use there are more advance thing which i will covering in the part 2.

Here are some of the extra command which will be useful

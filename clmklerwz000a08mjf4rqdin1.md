# Problem - Leetcode

Given `n` pairs of parentheses, write a function to *generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses*.Â 

**Example 1:**

```go
Input: n = 3
Output: ["((()))","(()())","(())()","()(())","()()()"]
```

**Example 2:**

```go
Input: n = 1
Output: ["()"]
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 8`
    

# Solution in Golang

```go
import "strings"
func generateParenthesis(n int) []string {
    var stack []string
    var res []string
    var backtrack func(int, int)
    backtrack = func(openN int, closedN int){
      if openN == n && closedN == n && openN == closedN{
        res = append(res, strings.Join(stack, ""))
        return
      }
      if openN < n{
        stack = append(stack, "(")
        backtrack(openN+1, closedN)
        pop(&stack)
      }
      if closedN < openN{
        stack = append(stack, ")")
        backtrack(openN, closedN+1)
        pop(&stack)
      }
    }
    backtrack(0,0)
    return res
}

func pop(list *[]string){
  length := len(*list)
  *list = (*list)[:length-1]
}
```

This Go code defines a function `generateParenthesis` that generates all valid combinations of parentheses pairs with a given number `n`. Here's a detailed explanation of the code:

1. `import "strings"`: This line imports the "strings" package, which is used for manipulating strings, particularly to join them together.
    
2. `func generateParenthesis(n int) []string { ... }`: This is the main function that takes an integer `n` as input and returns a slice of strings representing valid combinations of parentheses.
    
3. Inside this function, three main variables are defined:
    
    * `stack []string`: A slice of strings used to keep track of the currently open and unclosed parentheses.
        
    * `res []string`: A slice of strings to store the final result, i.e., valid combinations of parentheses.
        
    * `backtrack func(int, int)`: This is a nested function that performs the recursive backtracking to generate the combinations.
        
4. `backtrack` is a recursive function that takes two arguments:
    
    * `openN`: The count of open parentheses.
        
    * `closedN`: The count of closed parentheses.
        
5. The first `if` condition checks if we have reached the desired count of open and closed parentheses, both equal to `n`. If so, it means we have formed a valid combination, and it's added to the `res` slice by joining the `stack` using `strings.Join`.
    
6. Next, there are two `if` conditions:
    
    * `if openN < n { ... }`: This checks if the count of open parentheses is less than `n`. If true, it appends an open parenthesis "(" to the `stack`, increments the count of open parentheses, and then calls `backtrack` recursively. After the recursive call, it "pops" the last element from the `stack` to backtrack and explore other possibilities.
        
    * `if closedN < openN { ... }`: This checks if the count of closed parentheses is less than the count of open parentheses. If true, it appends a closed parenthesis ")" to the `stack`, increments the count of closed parentheses, and then calls `backtrack` recursively. It also pops the last element from the `stack` afterward for backtracking.
        
7. Finally, the `backtrack` function is initially called with `openN` and `closedN` both set to 0, starting the recursive process to generate valid combinations.
    
8. The function returns the `res` slice, which contains all the valid combinations of parentheses.
    
9. `func pop(list *[]string) { ... }`: This function is used to remove the last element from a slice of strings. It's a utility function called within `backtrack` to backtrack and explore other possibilities by removing the last element added to the `stack`.
    

In summary, this code uses a recursive backtracking approach to generate all valid combinations of parentheses pairs with a given count `n`. It maintains a `stack` to keep track of the currently open and unclosed parentheses and appends and pops elements from it while exploring possibilities. The valid combinations are stored in the `res` slice and returned as the final result.

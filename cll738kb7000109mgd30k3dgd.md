# Problem

Given an integer array `nums`, return *an array* `answer` *such that* `answer[i]` *is equal to the product of all the elements of*`nums` *except* `nums[i]`.

The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bit** integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time and without using the division operation.

**Example 1:**

```go
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
```

**Example 2:**

```go
Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]
```

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= nums.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>`
    
* `-30 <= nums[i] <= 30`
    
* The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bit** integer.
    

**Follow up:** Can you solve the problem in `O(1)` extra space complexity? (The output array **does not** count as extra space for space complexity analysis.)

# Answer in Golang

```go
func productExceptSelf(nums []int) []int {
	answer := make([]int, len(nums))
	pre := 1
	pos := 1
	for i := 0; i < len(nums); i++ {
		answer[i] = pre
		pre = nums[i] * pre
	}
	for i := len(nums) - 1; i >= 0; i-- {
		answer[i] *= pos
		pos = nums[i] * pos
	}
	return answer
}
```

This code defines a function named `productExceptSelf` that takes an array of integers `nums` as input and returns an array of integers. The returned array contains the product of all elements in the input array except the element at the same index.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the code works:

1. The function initializes an array called `answer` to store the final results. The size of this array is the same as the size of the input `nums` array.
    
2. It also initializes two variables `pre` and `suf` to keep track of products before and after the current element, respectively. `pre` is initially set to 1, and `suf` is also initially set to 1.
    
3. The first loop (for-loop) runs through the `nums` array from left to right. For each element at index `i`, it assigns the value of `pre` to the corresponding index in the `answer` array. Then, it updates the value of `pre` by multiplying it with the current element `nums[i]`.
    
4. After the first loop, the `pre` variable holds the product of all elements to the left of the current element.
    
5. The second loop (for-loop) runs through the `nums` array from right to left. For each element at index `i`, it multiplies the corresponding index in the `answer` array with the value of `suf`. Then, it updates the value of `suf` by multiplying it with the current element `nums[i]`.
    
6. After the second loop, the `suf` variable holds the product of all elements to the right of the current element.
    
7. Finally, the `answer` array contains the product of all elements except the element at the same index.
    
8. The function returns the `answer` array, which now holds the desired product of elements except self.
    

In summary, this code efficiently calculates the product of all elements except the current element for each index in the input array by using two passes through the array. The first pass calculates the products to the left of each element, and the second pass calculates the products to the right of each element, effectively giving the product of all elements except self.

# Problem - Leetcode

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i<sup>th</sup>` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return *the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction*. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

Â **Example 1:**

```go
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
```

**Example 2:**

```go
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= prices.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>`
    
* `0 <= prices[i] <= 10<sup>4</sup>`
    

# Answer-1 in Golang

```go
func maxProfit(prices []int) int {
	min := math.MaxUint32
	res := 0

	for _, price := range prices {
		if price > min {
			if price-min > res {
				res = price - min
			}
		} else {
			min = price
		}
	}
	return res
}
```

This code defines a function called `maxProfit` that takes a slice of integers called `prices` as its input and returns an integer value representing the maximum profit that can be obtained by buying and selling stocks based on the given prices.

Let's break down the code step by step:

1. The function starts by declaring two variables: `min` and `res`.
    
    * `min` is initialized with the maximum value representable by an unsigned 32-bit integer (this is set to a high value to ensure that any price value encountered will be smaller).
        
    * `res` is initialized to 0, which will store the maximum profit.
        
2. The function then enters a loop using a range-based iteration over the `prices` slice. In each iteration, it processes one `price` value from the slice.
    
3. Inside the loop, there's an `if` statement that checks whether the current `price` is greater than the current `min` value. This comparison is used to determine if the current price might lead to a potential profit.
    
4. If the `price` is indeed greater than `min`, it means there's a possibility of making a profit by selling at the current `price`. The code enters a nested `if` block.
    
5. Within the nested `if` block, the code calculates the potential profit that could be obtained by selling at the current `price` minus the `min` price encountered so far. If this potential profit is greater than the current `res` (maximum profit recorded so far), it updates `res` with the new potential profit. This is done to ensure that `res` holds the maximum profit achievable throughout the iteration.
    
6. If the `price` is not greater than `min`, it means the current `price` might be a better candidate for the minimum price to buy at. In this case, the `min` value is updated to the current `price`.
    
7. After the loop completes, the function returns the final value of `res`, which represents the maximum profit that can be obtained by buying and selling stocks based on the given `prices`.
    

In summary, this code is an implementation of the "buy low, sell high" strategy for maximizing profit in stock trading. It iterates through the `prices` array, keeping track of the minimum price encountered so far (`min`) and updating the maximum profit (`res`) that can be obtained. The key idea is to find the largest price difference between a minimum and a subsequent maximum price in the array.
